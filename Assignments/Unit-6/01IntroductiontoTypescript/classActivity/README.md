## Intro to System Design

### A good system

- Hardware: Deployed (HLD : High Level Design)
  - Server, Database
- Software: Code (LLD: Low Level Design)
  - Design Principle or Design Patterns

### What is typescript?

- Super set of js
- provide static type checking (Earlier error detection mechanism)

### Interview questions?

- What is typescritp?
  - Superset of js
  - js with types
  - ts is js at scale
- Why do we need typescript?
  - static type checking(checking the types at the compile-time)
    -we need OOPS: modularity (arranging the cosed in modules)
- Can we have scalable system without TS or without OOPS(Object Oriented Programming)?
  - YES, for maintainable is easy

### Initialise the ts project

`tsc --init`

### Run the code

`tsc`

### Internal Working

- Transpilation : .ts -> .js

### tsconfig.json

- modify how the .ts files are modified

### Types

- Basic types: number, string, boolean, object, array
- other types: any, null, void, undefiend, unknown
